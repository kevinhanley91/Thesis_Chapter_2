# Thesis_Chapter_2
__Purpose:__ Examining two existing claims reserving methods, Mack model and the “over-dispersed” Poisson GLM.

__Context:__ The second chapter of my research MSc in statistics thesis

__Language:__ R (Written in very basic R, could be refactored for efficency)

__Note:__ I did this project before I knew of the wonders of version control and git. Also the commenting and coding practices leave something to be desired. 

## Overview
Each section of this project has its own aims associated with it and collectively the project hopes to explore the workings of two commonly used stochastic methods for claims reserving. Section A applies the methods mentioned above in relation to general insurance data from Motor/Household and Professional Liability portfolios. The primary goal of this section is to compare the outstanding reserves provided between the differing methods. In Section B, the goal is to analyse the performance of the bootstrapping methods with regard to their prediction of future claims reserves and propose possible alterations that could be made to improve performance. When back testing the models on real data it must be taken into account that the real can have strange and not ideal characteristics. To test the models on a more basic level Section C aimed to examine the Mack bootstrap model using simulated data meeting all of the underlying assumptions of the model.
